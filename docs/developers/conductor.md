Conductor is provided as a [Flask Blueprints](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.10/blueprints/) for inclusion in a Flask codebase, and also includes a minimal Flask app for standalone use.

## Installation

Clone, and pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage

### Environment variables

Conductor needs some environment variables populated in order to function:

- `OS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
- `OS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`

```json
[
    {
        "id": "<package-unique-id>",
        "model": { ... }, # Babbage model
        "package": { .... }, # Original FDP
